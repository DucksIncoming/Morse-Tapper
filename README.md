# Morse Tapper

This is a relatively simple project that transcribes words spoken into a microphone in real-time then uses a custom-made morse code device to translate the text. The general intention is for this to be used for deaf people, however it's mostly a proof of concept.

This project can be used by anyone who wants to and is covered under the MIT license. Feel free to make additions or changes as you see fit and distribute/use this for personal or commercial purposes.

Current Status: Incomplete

Todo:
- Implement IBM Watson Speech-to-text neural network
- Create solution for translating text into morse code
- Build mechanism for replaying morse code physically
  - Make mechanism wearable
- Build in communication between neural network and morse code mechanism
